### Course Description

Artificial Intelligence (AI) aims to make a computer that can learn, plan and 
solve problems autonomously. AI applications include web search, speech recognition, 
face recognition, machine translation, autonomous driving, and automatic scheduling, 
etc. In this course, you will learn fundamental principles and techniques that 
drives such applications and have a chance to implement some of them. Specific
topics include search, constraint satisfaction, game playing, Markov decision
processes and logic. The main goal of the course is to equip students with the 
tools to tackle real problems in the era of big data.
