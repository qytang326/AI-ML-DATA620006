# Try to solve Grid World problem based on MDP.
# The grid world is of 5*5 size. The cells of the grid correspond to
# the states of the environment. At each cell, four actions are possible: north,
# south, east, and west, which deterministically cause the agent to move one
# cell in the respective direction on the grid. Actions that would take the agent
# off the grid leave its location unchanged, but also result in a reward of -1.
# Other actions result in a reward of 0, except those that move the agent out
# of the special states A and B. From state A, all four actions yield a reward of
# A_reward and take the agent to A_to. From state B, all actions yield a reward of B_reward
# and take the agent to B_to.The discount factor gamma=0.9.
# Try to use value iteration and policy iteration.
